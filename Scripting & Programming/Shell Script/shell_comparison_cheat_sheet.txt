Shell Script Comparison Cheat Sheet 🧾

🔢 NUMERIC COMPARISON (with [ ... ])
-------------------------------------
[ a -eq b ]   → a is equal to b
[ a -ne b ]   → a is not equal to b
[ a -gt b ]   → a is greater than b
[ a -ge b ]   → a is greater than or equal to b
[ a -lt b ]   → a is less than b
[ a -le b ]   → a is less than or equal to b

🅰️ STRING COMPARISON
----------------------
[ "$a" = "$b" ]    → a is equal to b (string)
[ "$a" != "$b" ]   → a is not equal to b
[ -z "$a" ]        → a is an empty string
[ -n "$a" ]        → a is a non-empty string
[ "$a" \< "$b" ]   → a is less than b (ASCII)
[ "$a" \> "$b" ]   → a is greater than b (ASCII)

🔁 LOGICAL OPERATORS
---------------------
[ cond1 ] && [ cond2 ]   → both conditions are true (AND)
[ cond1 ] || [ cond2 ]   → either condition is true (OR)

🧮 ARITHMETIC COMPARISON (with (( ... )))
------------------------------------------
(( a == b ))   → a is equal to b
(( a != b ))   → a is not equal to b
(( a > b ))    → a is greater than b
(( a >= b ))   → a is greater than or equal to b
(( a < b ))    → a is less than b
(( a <= b ))   → a is less than or equal to b

📂 FILE TEST OPERATORS
-----------------------
[ -e file ]   → file exists
[ -f file ]   → file is a regular file
[ -d file ]   → file is a directory
[ -s file ]   → file is not empty
[ -r file ]   → file is readable
[ -w file ]   → file is writable
[ -x file ]   → file is executable

🚀 BASH ADVANCED (with [[ ... ]])
----------------------------------
[[ $a == E* ]]  → true if $a starts with "E"
[[ $a =~ regex ]] → true if $a matches regex

Note:
- Use [[ ... ]] for better syntax in Bash (no escaping \< \>).
- Use (( ... )) for arithmetic expressions.
